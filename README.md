# IsharePortal, 2013

This repo contains full source code used for IsharePortal, a latest version of community based web portal, fully featured and improvised version of [Ishare+](https://github.com/heiswayi/ishare-plus). The project has been discontinued and the source code may be deprecated.

## Untold history...

IsharePortal was basically a web platform for a sharing community powered by students in USM Engineering Campus and established in February 2010. Originated from "Ishare", a simple WordPress-based site that just gathered all sharing IP servers (popularly known as sharerlinks) from all available sharers (could be anyone; student, staff, lecturer...) and automatically sorted them in one place, so other people (users/downloaders) can easily find the sharerlinks. Ishare started to grow in number of users and community faster while in the meantime I kept improving the portal code, until came to a decision to have a customized system instead. So, I built it from a scratch using PHP, MySQL and jQuery and continued to improve the code from time to time, feature by feature until we got the best and most used features that brought values to the community.

1. Fully customized chatbox with the choice of popular, funny and fun emoticons such as Tuzki, Onion head club emoticons.
2. Automated checking the online-offline of the sharerlinks/IP address of sharer's server.

At the end, IsharePortal finally became a quite complete CMS where featured with User Profile system and fully integrated with [PunBB](https://github.com/punbb/punbb) forum board. The source code of PunBB software included here is a modified version that I had made specifically to integrate with IsharePortal.

And then, we have our own tagline:

> For Sharers. By Sharers.

### The saddess part, shut down of IsharePortal operation

Due to its popularity among the students and everyone else, IsharePortal project had produced some controversies on its own which classified to its pros and cons to keep operating. Creating high traffic load within the network (intranet) due to massive use of bandwidth and publicly sharing of illegal content such as pirated movies using university network were the most highlighted cons by the university administration (known as PPKT). Later, I decided to [shut it down on March 12, 2013](http://heiswayi.github.io/ishare-in-memory) effectively.

Due to the community request, even though the main portal was shut down, I had created another simple script and I called it as a compact version of sharerlink system known as [iLink](https://github.com/heiswayi/ilink) to enable the sharers to continue promote their sharerlinks to the community. This script at least was able to reduce high traffic load and make it not so obvious on university administration radar. I'm not sure if iLink still be kept running until today or not as I already left my university a couple of years ago... I hope someone who administered it can keep operating it and contributing to the community.
